# Wireless-password-


Wireless password cracking is the practice of trying to break into a wifi network or defeat its wireless secuirity
-it targets the radio link and protocols used by wi-fi {WEP,WPA/WPA2,WPA3,WPA}

-The goal can be getting the network password,forcing a device off the network,intercepting traffic or bypassing access controls

# RADIO LINK 
This is the wireless connection itself , The invisible signals that travel (access point and your devices) like a phone or a laptop

# How WI-FI works

- wi-fi works by sending data through the air using radio waves

-so, when someone performs wireless cracking 

theyre trying to intercept or manipulate those radio signals to get information

- such as the network password or user data

# PROTOCOLS:
These are rules and standards WI-FI follows to communicate securely e.g

WEP(wired equivalent privacy) - Old and weak 

WPA(wifi protected access) - Newer , stronger ,encryption systems

WPS(WI-FI protected setup) - a convenience feature that can be abused


# WIRELESS PASSWORD CARCKING PREREQUISITES:

- Build an isolated network

-Kali linux + a compatible USB wiress card (We need a compatible USB wireless card that can run in monitor mode , that can help you capture wireless traffic data packet , network handshake {The 4 way handshake)

-aircrack-ng suite(airmon-ng, airdump, aireplay-ng,aircrack-ng)

# Aircrack-ng:
Its a collection of tools for wireless network auditing. it helps you capture wi-fi traffic 

 Test injection, perform attacks for collecting handshakes or cracking  WEP/WPA keys , and analyze/decrypt captures
