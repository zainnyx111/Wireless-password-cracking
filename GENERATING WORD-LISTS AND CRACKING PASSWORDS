# Password and the crunch command

These are two of the most common password-guessing

 BRUTEFORCE ATTACK: An exhaustive search that tries until it finds the right one. 

if the password space is all possible characters + length , a brute - force attacker will eventually try them all


 DICTIONARY ATTACK: A targeted guesser that tries entries from a curated list (a dictionary or wordlist) ;

common words , leak passwords, phrases or variants - instead of every posssible string. 

Its much easier when users pick real wors or predictable patterns
